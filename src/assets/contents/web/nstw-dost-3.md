## Overview

As part of a dedicated team of computer engineers, I contributed to the development and design of a government-owned website for the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Region 3. The website serves as a platform to highlight the various projects and events implemented by DOST in the region, providing valuable information and resources to the community. Leveraging the power of Django, a Python web framework, and utilizing modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, we were able to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website that effectively showcases DOST's achievements and initiatives. Our team's efforts have helped to improve the accessibility and transparency of the department, allowing for better communication and engagement with the community it serves.
