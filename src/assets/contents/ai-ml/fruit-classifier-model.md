This repository contains code and a trained Keras model for classifying fruits using image recognition and machine learning. The model was trained on a dataset of fruit images from the Fruits &amp; Vegetables by Jorge B's dataset.

The model was trained using a transfer learning approach, where a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model was fine-tuned on the fruit image dataset. The pre-trained CNN model was the ResNet50 architecture with weights trained on the ImageNet dataset.

To use the model, simply load it into a TensorFlow or Keras session and pass it a fruit image. The model will output a probability distribution over the 5 fruit categories. The category with the highest probability is the predicted fruit type.
