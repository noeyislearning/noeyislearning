## Notebook Description

This Jupyter notebook explores the GitHub history of the Scala programming language, a versatile and powerful language known for its concise and elegant syntax. The analysis focuses on examining the project's pull request data, analyzing contributions, and visualizing the development trends within the Scala community.

## Notebook Summary

The notebook aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Scala programming language's GitHub history. It covers various aspects of the project, including its activity, developer contributions, collaboration, and recent developments.

Here's a brief summary of what each section of the notebook entails:

1. **Import Libraries**, we begin by importing necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. These libraries will be used throughout the analysis.

2. **Data Preparation**, in this section, we load and explore the dataset, preparing it for subsequent analysis. Multiple CSV files containing pull request data are loaded and their initial structure is displayed.

3. **Cleaning the Data**, we merge two DataFrames and preprocess the data. The date columns are converted to datetime type, an essential step for time-based analysis.

4. **Merging the DataFrames**, we combine the DataFrames to create a unified dataset for analysis. The merged DataFrame is presented to provide an overview of the combined data.

5. **Question No. 1: Is this project still actively maintained?** This section calculates and visualizes the number of pull requests submitted each year and each month. These visualizations help us assess the project's ongoing activity and its evolution over time.

6. **Question No. 2: Is there camaraderie in the project?** We investigate developer interactions by calculating and visualizing the number of pull requests submitted by each user. This analysis identifies highly involved contributors and assesses camaraderie within the project.

7. **Question No. 3: Who made the last ten pull requests on a given file?** We pinpoint the file for which the last ten pull requests were submitted, filter the dataset to select relevant entries, and list the users who made these last ten pull requests.

8. **Question No. 4: What files were changed in the last ten pull requests?** This section identifies the last ten pull requests and lists the files changed in these pull requests. It also calculates the number of changes per file type and provides insights into recent project developments.

9. **Question No. 5: The pull requests of two special developers**. We focus on two specific developers, "xeno-by" and "soc," filter the dataset for their entries, and analyze the number of pull requests submitted by each developer.

10. **Question No. 6: Visualize the contributions of developer.** This section groups the dataset by developers, calculates the number of pull requests for each developer, and visualizes their contributions using a bar chart.

## Other Objectives Tackled

In addition to answering specific questions, this notebook provides insights into the project's overall activity, camaraderie among developers, and individual developer contributions. These insights are valuable for project maintainers, contributors, and stakeholders.

## Future Considerations

The notebook suggests potential areas for further exploration, including trend analysis, collaboration networks, community engagement, review and maintenance processes, contribution types, and project governance. These considerations can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the Scala programming language's GitHub history and its development dynamics.
