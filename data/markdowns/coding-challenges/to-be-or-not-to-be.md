# To Be or Not to Be

## Problem Statement

Write a function `expect` that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value `val` and return an object with the following two functions.

- `toBe(val)` accepts another value and returns `true` if the two values `===` each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error `"Not Equal"`.
- `notToBe(val)` accepts another value and returns `true` if the two values `!==` each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error `"Equal"`.

**Example 1:**

> **Input**: `func = () => expect(5).toBe(5)`  
> **Output**: `{"value": true}`  
> **Explanation**: `Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:`

**Example 2:**

> **Input**: `low = 1000, high = 13000`  
> **Output**: `[1234,2345,3456,4567,5678,6789,12345]`

**Constraints:**

- • `10 <= low <= high <= 10^9`

## Solution

### Python

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def sequentialDigits(self, low: int, high: int) -> List[int]:
        queue = deque(range(1, 10))
        result = []

        while queue:
            num = queue.popleft()
            if low <= num <= high:
                result.append(num)
            last_digit = num % 10
            if last_digit < 9:
                queue.append(num * 10 + last_digit + 1)

        return sorted(result)
```

## Explanation — Python

The provided Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `sequentialDigits`. This method generates all the sequential digits between two given numbers, `low` and `high`, and returns them in a sorted list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. `queue = deque(range(1, 10))`: This line initializes a double-ended queue with numbers from 1 to 9. A deque (pronounced "deck") is a generalization of stacks and queues that supports thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque.
2. `result = []`: This line initializes an empty list to store the sequential digits.
3. The `while` loop continues as long as there are elements in the `queue`.
4. `num = queue.popleft()`: This line removes an element from the left side of the deque and assigns it to `num`.
5. If `num` is between `low` and `high` (inclusive), it is appended to the `result` list.
6. `last_digit = num % 10`: This line gets the last digit of `num`.
7. If the last digit is less than 9, a new number is generated by appending `last_digit + 1` to `num` and this new number is added to the right side of the deque. This is done by multiplying `num` by 10 and adding `last_digit + 1`.
8. Finally, the function returns the `result` list sorted in ascending order.

This method generates all the sequential digits (like 12, 23, 34, ..., 89, 123, 234, ..., 789, 1234, etc.) between `low` and `high`. For example, if `low` is 10 and `high` is 130, the method returns `[12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 123]`.
