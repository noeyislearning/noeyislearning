## Overview

In this analysis, we delve into the fascinating world of retail data to unlock valuable insights for businesses. Market Basket Analysis is a powerful technique that allows retailers to understand customer behavior, identify item associations, and offer personalized recommendations. The primary goal of this notebook is to help retailers optimize their product catalog, enhance marketing strategies, and ultimately improve customer engagement and satisfaction.

## Data

- Dataset: The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)**. It consists of transaction records including information such as item name, quantity, date, price, customer ID, and country.

- Preprocessing:
  - Handled missing values: Removed rows with missing values in the "Itemname" and "CustomerID" columns.
  - Converted the "Date" column to datetime format.

## Methodology

### Key Steps

- Data loading, inspection, and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Transaction data formatting for Apriori algorithm
- Aprirori algorithm implementation
  - Parameters used: Support threshold = 0.01, Confidence threshold = 0.5
- Rule evaluation and selection
- Key Decisions:
  - Chose Market Basket Analysis to uncover hidden patterns in customer purchasing habits.
  - Set thresholds for support and confidence based on the dataset characteristics and business objectives.

### Key Insights

- Identified significant associations between products, such as:
  - (REGENCY SUGAR BOWL GREEN) âž” (REGENCY MILK JUG PINK) with high lift (56.60)
  - (SET/6 RED SPOTTY PAPER PLATES) âž” (SET/6 RED SPOTTY PAPER CUPS) with high confidence (0.72)
