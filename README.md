#### Technical Education & Open Source Contributions Organizations

##### This organization, **[Haizoen](https://github.com/thehaizoen)**, fosters a collaborative learning environment for university students, especially at [Holy Angel University](https://github.com/thehaizoen). We provide mentorship and resources to help students in computer engineering master various subjects, including web development (full-stack), microprocessors, and more. In the other hand, **[Cogxen](https://github.com/cogxen)** focuses on data science, machine learning, and AI-focused organization. Contributions are welcome and highly appreciated; from students, external collaborators, and anyone passionate about the field. We aim to build a strong community for learning and growth.

###### I have consolidated all my previous projects onto a single GitHub account, [this account](https://github.com/noeyislearning), this includes everything from college days to the present, with a focus on consolidating my knowledge-based notes. That's why you'll see a steady stream of contributions over the years!
